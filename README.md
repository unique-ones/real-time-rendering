# Real-Time Rendering Engine

This repository contains a rendering engine that encompasses the
book ["Real-Time-Rendering"](https://www.realtimerendering.com) by Tomas Akenine-Möller.

---

The main goal of this engine is to explore the various topics of computer graphics that are described in the book, using
a small engine based on [Vulkan®](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/), the new generation graphics and compute API from
Khronos.

## Prerequisites

In order to try out the engine, you must have the [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com) installed, preferably with the
optional `glm` headers
package.
